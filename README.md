**Learning/Creating a Portfolio:**

      **Bioinformatics Problems**
      If anyone is looking to get more experience with bioinformatics problems, genetics, or just want to learn to code, this may be a good resource:
	 https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/

      If you have no knowledge of python, I recommend you start in the python village and work your way through the problems. 
      I recommend you try to learn from the hints and googling, but this github (https://github.com/hrslkvc/rosalind/tree/ee449fa612e8a00bd5f4c52b5f48ff07a4ec0453) 
	 provides some solutions and rebelScience (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEO9FzOPiOQ&ab_channel=rebelScience) has a short, 
	 more thorough walkthrough of these problems and many others which I also recommend.


      If you have more experience then you may want to take a look at this tree of problems 
	 (https://rosalind.info/problems/tree-view/) or of course feel free to look around.


      This community has created a large resource of free short courses and has a discord community with professionals and students.

     **Books**
      If books are more your speed, here is a handbook developed by the OSSU community https://eriqande.github.io/eca-bioinf-handbook/
      And this list has books for beginners in Bioinformatics https://bookauthority.org/books/beginner-bioinformatics-books
      All are on Amazon but beware of these sites https://z-lib.org/ and https://libgen.li/
      They seem perfectly helpful in that they deliver free pdfs of expensive books but they are also free. 
	 I can't remember what I was saying. Anyway.



Internship/Resume/CV info:

	If you are looking for advice on getting an internship, r/Bioinformatics has a three part series by professional Bioinformaticians and hiring managers on what to expect in an interview:

	https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/7pglon/hiring_for_bioinformatics_part_2/
	https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/7pxkqi/hiring_for_bioinformatics_part_3/

	If you need any advice on your resume or cover letter, UCD's internship and career center will review and help you create a better document(Which I always forget about so I thought it would be a good resource): https://icc.ucdavis.edu/services/document-review

	It has been difficult to find truly open source materials to learn bioinformatics, so if you have any resources you want to add, please feel free. I would like to compile these resources so that people can easily access them as they please.
