# Bioinformatics-Resources

**Introduction**

	This repository is meant to serve as a resource to find open source tools to learn bioinformatics or introduce yourself to coding for any reason you may wish.
	I plan to update this list as often as possible but I recommend checking back every week or so considering the pace at which this has been created.
	If you have any additional resources you found useful that you would like added to this resource list, you can reach me at cnthornton@ucdavis.edu
	Disclaimer:
	This is just a list of open source resources 
	
	The course of action I recommend you take if starting at no knowledge of coding:
	1. Work through Rosalind's python village.
		-If this is difficult, remember that Rosalind has hidden hints that may be of use
		-Watch rebelScience's Rosalind Python Village series: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEO9FzOPiOQ
	2. Take a look at Rosalind's Bioinformatics Stronghold tree, Bioinformatics Armory, Textbook Track, and Algorithmic Heights
		-I understand that this is an immense amount of work. You will find with time and practice they will become easier to complete
		-These are not necessary to complete (everyone takes different paths) however, I recommend keeping these in mind and keeping them in view as a goal
	3. Look at the curriculum of free courses at https://github.com/ossu/bioinformatics#curriculum
		-Take any of these courses that you need or feel weak in. They are all vital to Bioinformatics
	4. Build tools for yourself to use as shortcuts when analyzing genomic data
		-These would be useful while working through Rosalind and OSSU problems, but it is better to get as much practice as possible
		-rebelScience has a DNAtoolkit series that may be a good framework: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpSOMAcxEB_hD18TAtBrTlRJDyu-PmRbj
	5. Create a Portfolio of your tools and abilities(problems you have solved)
		-Find your favorite Bioinformatics study and try to replicate their data processing using Python, R, or C++ and include this in your portfolio
	6. Practice coding challenges and apply for internships/jobs.
	


**Learning/Creating a Portfolio:**

      **Bioinformatics Problems**
      If anyone is looking to get more experience with bioinformatics problems, genetics, or just want to learn to code, this may be a good resource:
	 https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/

      If you have no knowledge of python, I recommend you start in the python village and work your way through the problems. 
      I recommend you try to learn from the hints and googling, but this github (https://github.com/hrslkvc/rosalind/tree/ee449fa612e8a00bd5f4c52b5f48ff07a4ec0453) 
	 provides some solutions and rebelScience (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEO9FzOPiOQ&ab_channel=rebelScience) has a short, 
	 more thorough walkthrough of these problems and many others which I also recommend.


      If you have more experience then you may want to take a look at this tree of problems 
	 (https://rosalind.info/problems/tree-view/) or of course feel free to look around.


      This community has created a large resource of free short courses and has a discord community with professionals and students.

     **Books**
      If books are more your speed, here is a handbook developed by the OSSU community https://eriqande.github.io/eca-bioinf-handbook/
      And this list has books for beginners in Bioinformatics https://bookauthority.org/books/beginner-bioinformatics-books
      All are on Amazon but beware of these sites https://z-lib.org/ and https://libgen.li/
      These sites violate copyright law. They can be deceptive and seem perfectly helpful in that they deliver free pdfs of expensive books but they are also free. 
      I can't remember what I was saying. Anyway.



Internship/Resume/CV info:

	If you are looking for advice on getting an internship, r/Bioinformatics has a three part series by professional Bioinformaticians and hiring managers on what to expect in an interview:
	https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/7ozqau/hiring_for_bioinformatics_part_1/
	https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/7pglon/hiring_for_bioinformatics_part_2/
	https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/7pxkqi/hiring_for_bioinformatics_part_3/

	If you need any advice on your resume or cover letter, UCD's internship and career center will review and help you create a better document(Which I always forget about so I thought it would be a good resource): https://icc.ucdavis.edu/services/document-review

	It has been difficult to find truly open source materials to learn bioinformatics, so if you have any resources you want to add, please feel free. I would like to compile these resources so that people can easily access them as they please.
