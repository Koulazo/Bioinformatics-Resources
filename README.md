**Learning/Creating a Portfolio:**

      **Bioinformatics Problems**
      If anyone is looking to get more experience with bioinformatics problems, genetics, or just want to learn to code, this may be a good resource:     https://rosalind.info/problems/locations/

      If you have no knowledge of python, I recommend you start in the python village and work your way through the problems. I recommend you try to learn from the hints and googling, but this github (https://github.com/hrslkvc/rosalind/tree/ee449fa612e8a00bd5f4c52b5f48ff07a4ec0453) provides some solutions and rebelScience (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEO9FzOPiOQ&ab_channel=rebelScience) has a short, more thorough walkthrough of these problems and many others which I also recommend.

      If you have more experience then you may want to take a look at this tree of problems (https://rosalind.info/problems/tree-view/) or of course feel free to look around.

      This community has created a large resource of free short courses and has a discord community with professionals and students. https://github.com/ossu/bioinformatics#curriculum 


      **Books**
      If books are more your speed, here is a handbook developed by the OSSU community https://eriqande.github.io/eca-bioinf-handbook/
      And this list has books for beginners in Bioinformatics https://bookauthority.org/books/beginner-bioinformatics-books

       All are on Amazon but beware of these sites https://z-lib.org/ and https://libgen.li/
      They seem perfectly helpful in that they deliver free pdfs of expensive books but they are also free. I can't remember what I was saying. Anyway.
